# TSL2585 Breakout Board

This repository contains the [KiCad](http://kicad.org/) project
with the complete circuit schematics and PCB layout for a breakout
board that supports the [TSL2585](https://ams.com/en/tsl2585) light sensor from
[AMS](https://ams-osram.com/). This sensor has Photopic, UV-A, and IR channels,
as well as flicker detection.

AMS makes several other sensors that are extremely similar to this one, but they
are not pin compatible.
